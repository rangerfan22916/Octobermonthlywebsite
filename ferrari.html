    <h1>
        Enzo Ferrari founded the Ferrari automobile company in 1939, initially as Auto Avio Costruzioni in Modena,
        Italy.
        After his stint as a race car driver and a successful career with Alfa Romeo, he was determined to create a car
        that reflected his passion for speed and innovation.
        The first vehicle produced under the Ferrari name was the 125 S in 1947, which marked the beginning of Ferrari
        as a manufacturer of high-performance sports cars.
        Enzo's vision was to blend racing technology with luxury, leading to the development of vehicles that not only
        excelled on the racetrack but also appealed to car enthusiasts.
        His commitment to performance and engineering excellence quickly established Ferrari as a dominant force in
        motorsports, earning numerous victories in various racing events.
        This dedication to quality and competition laid the foundation for Ferrari's legendary status in the automotive
        world, making it synonymous with speed, luxury, and racing heritage.</h1>
