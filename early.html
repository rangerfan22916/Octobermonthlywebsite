    <h1>
        Enzo Ferrari was born on February 20, 1898, in Modena, Italy, to a modest family.
        Growing up, he developed a passion for cars and racing at a young age, sparked by his fatherâ€™s interest in
        automobiles.
        In his early teens, Ferrari attended the 1908 Circuito di Bologna race with his father and brother,
        which left a lasting impression on him and inspired his dream of becoming a racing driver. However,
        his aspirations faced early setbacks when he dropped out of formal schooling following the loss of his father
        and brother in 1916.
        Shortly after, World War I interrupted his plans further when he was drafted into the Italian army. Ferrari fell
        ill with the flu during his service,
        which ultimately led to his discharge, and upon his return to civilian life, he found Italy in economic
        hardship. Despite these challenges,
        Ferrari's determination to pursue his passion for automobiles remained unwavering, eventually leading him to a
        job at CMN (Costruzioni Meccaniche Nazionali),
        where he began his career as a test driver and mechanic, setting the stage for his future in racing and car
        manufacturing.</h1>
