    <h1>Enzo Ferrari's racing career began in the early 1920s when he joined Alfa Romeo as a test driver and race car
        driver.
        His talent on the track quickly earned him recognition, and he became a successful competitor in various racing
        events.
        Enzo achieved his first major victory in 1924 at the Targa Florio, a prestigious Italian race. Throughout the
        1920s and 1930s,
        he continued to race for Alfa Romeo, winning numerous titles and establishing himself as one of the top drivers
        of his time. However,
        after a serious accident in 1932 that nearly cost him his life, he decided to shift his focus from driving to
        managing and building race cars.
        This transition laid the groundwork for his future as the founder of Ferrari, where he would channel his racing
        passion into developing high-performance
        vehicles and leading the Ferrari team to victory in many prestigious races, including Formula One.
